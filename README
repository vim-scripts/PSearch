PSearch offers a tiny preview for your searches.

Execute the :PSearch command and type something. You'll see a preview
of all the lines where the pattern you gave matches in the current file. The 
pattern is the one you would normally use doing searches with '/' and '?'.

To interact with the matches list use the following keys:

  UP, CTRL+K : move up in the list.

  DOWN, CTRL+J : move down in the list.

  RETURN, CTRL+G : go to the selected match.

  ESC, CTRL+C : close the matches list
